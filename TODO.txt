task 1:
	- we need a really good python FFT that is available. Currently we are using the numpy
	  FFT but I'm hoping we could do better.
	- we need a good way of removing the background noise that the FFT is receiving. 
	  Currently I'm thinking about sampling the background every couple of seconds and
	  taking the average over all the runs then "subtracting" this off from the original 
	  signal.
	- we could also get a better signal with a better mic
	- we need to update sound_animation.py slightly so that it is compatible with the changes made so far

task 2: 
        - using the harmonic from the program insert these harmonics into the synth and show 
	  that the sound is the same as the actual instrument being played.

task 3:
	- we need code that can identify chords


task 4: (long term project)
	- we need code that will take a music and write the sheet music
